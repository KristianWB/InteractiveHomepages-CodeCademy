Now you have three doors and the cursor changes on hover for all three; but only your first door opens. Put JavaScript to work to open those other two doors!

Go to your script.js file and create two new global variables called doorImage2 and doorImage3. Use a JavaScript DOM method to assign these global variables to the HTML elements with the id of door2 and door3 respectively.

Be mindful to change the logic if you decide to copy and paste the logic from the doorImage1.onclick() function - or else youâ€™ll have three ChoreBots!

To prevent this from happening, first create a global variable called beachDoorPath and assign this URL string as its value:

Now within the empty .onclick() functions of doorImage2 and doorImage3, write code so that doorImage2 will change to the beach image and doorImage3 will change to the space image when clicked.
