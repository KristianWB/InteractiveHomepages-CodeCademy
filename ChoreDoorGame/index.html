You have three doors but they’re all huddled in the top left corner. Give your website some flavor and symmetry by expanding your index.html and style.css pages.

Right after the opening <body> tag, create a new <div> element with the class name "header". Inside this new <div> parent element, create an <img> child element for the logo image. Copy this url and paste into the src:

https://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-content/projects/chore-door/images/logo.svg

Be aware that the logo is the same color as your current background so don’t panic if you can’t see the image - this is where the CSS gets its chance to contribute!

    <div class="header">
      <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-content/projects/chore-door/images/logo.svg">

Good work - you have your game title. Now it’s time to write the instructions to your game. First, let’s create a title for these instructions and flank this title with a pretty star on each side.

Beneath the <div class="header"> element but above the <div class="door-row"> element, create a new <div> element with the class name "title-row". Inside this element, create two images using this URL:

https://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-content/projects/chore-door/images/star.svg

Refresh your page and you should see two small stars huddled in the top-left corner of their <div> underneath the logo image.

-->
    <div class="title-row">
      
      <!--

			With the title now prominently displayed, the next objective is to explain the game to anyone who wants to play. You’ll use an HTML table to display style the instructions. This will make it easier to line up the number labels with the instruction text itself.

In the index.html file, beneath the <div class="title-row"> element, create a new <table> with the class name "instructions-row". Inside of that, create four identical empty <tr> elements.

Open the hint for the correct table syntax.
			-->
      <table class="instructions-row">
        
        <!--
#28
Nested inside each <tr> parent element should be two <td> child elements:

    The first <td> of each child pair has the class name "instructions-number".
    The second <td> of each child pair has the class name "instructions-text".


-->
        <tr class="instructions-text">
          <!--
#29
In between each <td></td> element with the instructions-number class, add the numbers 1 through 4 so that these four <td></td> elements are numbered sequentially.
-->
          
          <!--
#30
Going down each <td> element with the "instructions-text" class sequentially, copy and paste the four directions to the game in order:

    Hiding behind one of these doors is the ChoreBot.
    Your mission is to open all of the doors without running into the ChoreBot.
    If you manage to avoid the ChoreBot until you open the very last door, you win!
    See if you can score a winning streak!

Save your code and refresh your page to ensure that your game has four directions listed.
-->
          <td class="instructions-number">1</td>
          <td class="instructions-text">Hiding behind one of these doors is the ChoreBot.</td>
        </tr>        
        <tr>
          <td class="instructions-number">2</td>
          <td class="instructions-text">Your mission is to open all of the doors without running into the ChoreBot.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td class="instructions-number">3</td>
          <td class="instructions-text">If you manage to avoid the ChoreBot until you open the very last door, you win!</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td class="instructions-number">4</td>
          <td class="instructions-text">See if you can score a winning streak!</td>
        </tr>
      </table>

Now to add the actual instructions title.

In between the star images, place a <p> sibling element with the class name "instructions-title". Type Instructions inside this <p> element.
-->
      <p class="instructions-title">Instructions</p>
      <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-content/projects/chore-door/images/star.svg">
    </div>
    
<!-- 
#2
Now your first objective is to build one door which will hide the dreaded ChoreBot.

Look at the index.html starting code. Inside the <body>, create a <div> parent element with the class name "door-row". Next, create an <img> child element inside this <div>.
-->
    <div class="door-row">
      
<!-- 
#3
Copy and paste this link in the image element’s src:

https://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-content/projects/chore-door/images/closed_door.svg

Refresh the page to display the first closed door for your game.

-->
<!--
1.4
A user should know that this closed door can be clicked.

Assign this <img> element an id attribute with the value of door1. Place this id before the src.

-->
<!-- 
1.5
Connecting this id to the CSS will allow you to adjust the closed door’s properities - including changing the cursor when you hover over it.

Navigate to the style.css starting code and create an CSS ID selector for the #door1. Inside this selector underneath the body selector, assign the cursor property a value of pointer.

Refresh the page and notice that the cursor changes to a pointer as soon as you hover over the door.

-->
<!--

Being a good programmer means doing your best to stay DRY(“Don’t repeat yourself”). Looking at the style.css code, it would be repetitive to create CSS ID selectors for #door2 and #door3 just to give them the same cursor property.

Navigate back to the index.html and assign each image a new class of door-frame. Make sure to place the class between the id and the src.

Listing the id and class in this order is an important reminder of CSS specificity (the order by which the browser decides which CSS styles will be displayed).
-->
      <img id="door1"
           class="door-frame"
           src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-content/projects/chore-door/images/closed_door.svg">
<!--
1.11
You’ve completed your first objective of getting a door and opening a door. Now you’re going to add two more closed doors in the same parent <div> as your first door.

Under your original <img> element, create two new <img> elements and assign them the same src as your original <img> element. Their id values, however, will be assigned door2 and door3 respectively. Make sure to place the id before the src.
-->
      <img id="door2"
           class="door-frame"
           src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-content/projects/chore-door/images/closed_door.svg">
      <img id="door3"
           class="door-frame"
           src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-content/projects/chore-door/images/closed_door.svg">
    </div>

<!--
1.6
The pointer’s purpose is to indicate to the user that the closed door image can be clicked. CSS made this possible; but it’s the JavaScript that makes that click do something.

All JavaScript logic will be written within the script.js file but in order to have that logic interact with the HTML, you first need to establish a connection between the script.js page and the index.html. In the index.html page, create a <script> element directly above the closing </body> tag. Inside the opening <script> tag, set the type as "text/javascript" and the src as "script.js". Then immediately close the element with a </script> tag.
-->
    <script type="text/javascript" src="script.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
