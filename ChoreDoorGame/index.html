Now your first objective is to build one door which will hide the dreaded ChoreBot.

Look at the index.html starting code. Inside the <body>, create a <div> parent element with the class name "door-row". Next, create an <img> child element inside this <div>.
-->
    <div class="door-row">
      
<!-- 
1.3
Copy and paste this link in the image element’s src:

https://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-content/projects/chore-door/images/closed_door.svg

Refresh the page to display the first closed door for your game.

-->
<!--
1.4
A user should know that this closed door can be clicked.

Assign this <img> element an id attribute with the value of door1. Place this id before the src.

-->
<!-- 
1.5
Connecting this id to the CSS will allow you to adjust the closed door’s properities - including changing the cursor when you hover over it.

Navigate to the style.css starting code and create an CSS ID selector for the #door1. Inside this selector underneath the body selector, assign the cursor property a value of pointer.

Refresh the page and notice that the cursor changes to a pointer as soon as you hover over the door.

-->
      <img id="door1"
           src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-content/projects/chore-door/images/closed_door.svg">
    </div>
